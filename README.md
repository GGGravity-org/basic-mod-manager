## [Example Link](https://exam.3gv.org/bmm/)
## An open-source mod manager that supports easy mod sharing, simple injection, and a clean API for listing, searching, and loading mods.
## -----
## Usage
**1.** Put the [index.php](https://github.com/GGGravity-org/basic-mod-manager/blob/main/index.php) and [api.php](https://github.com/GGGravity-org/basic-mod-manager/blob/main/api.php) into your sites files, make sure they are in the same folder.
**2.** Customize the index as you wish, the theme is pretty bland. 
**3.** visit the index by going to the folder you put them in. Say if you put them in /my-cool-game/mods/ and your site was hi.com you would go to hi.com/my-cool-game/mods
**4.** Make an example mod. Its pretty easy, just go to the "Create Mod" tab.
**5.** Implement the api into your game. Check out the [api usage example](https://github.com/GGGravity-org/basic-mod-manager/blob/main/api-usage-example.cs) for help. You url is your index with /api.php on the end, so say hi.com/my-cool-game/mods/api.php
**6.** Check if it works! If it doesnt work debug and submit an issue if the issue persists. **Enjoy!**
